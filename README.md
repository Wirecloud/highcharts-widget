This [WireCloud widget](http://wirecloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) allows to create interactive charts/graphs using
the Highcharts framework

## Build

Be sure to have installed [Node.js](http://node.js) and [Bower](http://bower.io) in your system. For example, you can
install it on Ubuntu and Debian running the following commands:

```console
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo npm install -g bower
```

If you want the last version of the widget, you should change to the `develop` branch:

```console
git checkout develop
```

Install other npm dependencies by running: (need root because some libraries use applications, check package.json before
to be sure)

```console
sudo npm install
```

For build the widget you need download grunt:

```console
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

And now, you can use grunt:

```console
grunt
```

If everything goes well, you will find a wgt file in the `dist` folder.
